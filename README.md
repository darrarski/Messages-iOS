Messages app prototype for iOS

**Notice: current state of the project is "for R&D purposes only"**

Disappointed with availabe libraries and components for replicating Messages app UI in iOS application, I decided to create my own solution. It shows how to build chat-alike user interface that allows sending and receiving messages. It's not "one size fits all", not perfect nor optimal. It's definately much simplier than some messaging-UI libraries, and because of this, easier to maintain and customize. Messages list is build using `UICollectionView` managed by [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) library. There is no backend logic in this project - app uses mocked up service that simulates communication with server side.

Special thanks to [turekj](https://github.com/turekj) for help with developing simple solution to preserve `UIScrollView` content offset when reloading data.
